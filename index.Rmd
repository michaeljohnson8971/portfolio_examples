# Maps of Boston
Here are two maps of Boston. I might include some text here about this set of maps.

## Interactive Map
This interactive map shows the percentage of households countywide with children as a proportion of the total count of households in Suffolk county. 
* demonstrates the following skills: Displaying data on an interactive map

## Zonal Aggregation Map
###Map #1  shows the trees within 500 meters of schools across the city of Boston. It also notes the percentage of total trees within 500 meters of all school. 
* demonstrates the following skills: Calculating and displaying relationships among point and polygon layers based on distance

###Map #2 Boston Tree and Schools
Map#2 shows the count of schools per community area in Boston
*demonstrates aggregating points to a polygon

## Accessibility
This map shows accessibility based on a distance-decay function of the walking time to the nearest transit stop. It demonstrates the following skills:

* Displaying multiple vector layers on the same map
* Calculating and displaying accessibility, based on travel time
* Displaying raster data on a map

## Maps of San Luis Obispo
Here are two maps of San Luis Obispo, California. I might include some text here as well.

## Isochrones
This map shows isochrones based on transit travel times to the nearest school. It demonstrates the following skills:

* Displaying multiple vector layers on the same map
* Calculating and displaying accessibility, based on travel time
