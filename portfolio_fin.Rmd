# Maps of Boston
Here are two maps of Boston. I might include some text here about this set of maps.

## Interactive Map
This interactive map shows the percentage of households countywide with children as a proportion of the total count of households in Suffolk county:
* demonstrates the following skills: Displaying data on an interactive map

# Zonal Aggregation Map
##Map #1  shows the trees within 500 meters of schools across the city of Boston. It also notes the percentage of total trees within 500 meters of all school: 
* demonstrates the following skills: Calculating and displaying relationships among point and polygon layers based on distance

##Map #2 Boston Tree and Schools
Map#2 shows the count of schools per community area in Boston:
*demonstrates aggregating points to a polygon

## Accessibility
This map shows accessibility based on a distance-decay function of the walking time to the nearest transit stop. It demonstrates the following skills:

* Displaying multiple vector layers on the same map
* Calculating and displaying accessibility, based on travel time
* Displaying raster data on a map

## Maps of East Boston
Here is a  historical map of East Boston with current boundaries and highway overlaid:
* Geo-referencing a raster image
